A <span class="caps muted">S</span><span class="caps">CSS</span> micro-framework
for developing performant sites with stunning typography, Embrace was designed
from the get-go for speed, utility <span class="amp">&amp;</span> accessibility.
{: class="lede" }

Embrace tries to be as transparent as possible, applying baseline typographic
styles directly to html elements and then providing _optional_ modules to style
your site. Disable any styles your project does not need and ship _only_ the code
you use.
